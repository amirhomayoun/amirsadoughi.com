## Me in a paragraph
My name is Amir Sadoughi (if you don’t speak Persian, consider that “h” after “g” to be silent (just as in ghost!)).
I am a software developer, and like free and open-source software. I was introduced to Linux in 2004 (Thank you [Canonical](https://www.canonical.com/) for the [shipit](http://blog.canonical.com/2011/04/05/shipit-comes-to-an-end/) program!)
I have been working at Bloomberg L.P. since 2013 and write financial software using C++/C/Python/Fortran/Javascript.
