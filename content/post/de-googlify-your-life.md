Instead of waiting for this to be "complete", I am going to release it, and will keep adding to it.

Things you can do to reduce the presence of Google in your life:

* Up until now
    * Check [deseat.me](deseat.me) to see what accounts you have online. Stop logging into websites using Google
    * Check [degooglisons](https://degooglisons-internet.org/liste?l=en) to see what services there are you can use.
    * Check [your Google activity](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity) to see what data Google has stored. You can [download](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1) all your data.
* Going forward
    * Ads/Tracking
        * Follow [this](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/features/how-to-stop-google-from-tracking-you-on-the-web-550286) to stop Google from showing you targeted ads. 
        * Switching from Google Chrome (and chromium?) to Firefox
    * Search
        * Try switching from [Google](https://google.com) to [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com) or [framabee](https://framabee.org/). Right now I am using [startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) and unlike duckduckgo, I am happy with it!
        * Install plugins in your browser to stop Google from tracking the URL you click on [google-no-tracking-url](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-no-tracking-url/)
    * Email
        * Look into replacements for Gmail. [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) and [mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/) are the two candidates. 
        * Look into GPG and encrypting your email in general.
    * Maps
        * Keep using Google Maps!
        * Stop the location tracking, you won't be able to fully turn it off though
    * Other services
        * Switch your domain management from Google domains to Namecheap
        * Switch from Google keep to a note taking and syncing via syncthing system
        * Switch your DNS server from Google's to Dns.watch or OpenNIC
