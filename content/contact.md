I thought about putting one of those contact forms here, I don't remember the last time I used one to reach out to someone though!

So, if you have my number, give me a call (or text me). You can also email me at myemail@mywebsite.com

You can always try and reach out on LinkedIn or any other social media platform (Links on the left).
